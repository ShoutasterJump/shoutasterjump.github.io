			<h2 class="mainTitle">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<h3 class="faqQuestion">How do you decide what games make it onto the site?</h3>
			<p class="faqAnswer">For a game to be added to this website, it truely has to be a extraordinary game at the highest level.
			A lot of the more popular games are the flashy, piece-sacrficing, explosive games where the best players in the world 
			construct relentless attacks against their opponents who may have had only the slightest weakeness in their position.</p>
			<p class="faqAnswer">However, some of the best games in my opninon are the games where the positon is played to near 
			perfection, not giving any chances for a comeback and winning a slow and careful game. These games show a level of mastery 
			that only a top player has the skill to execute, making them also a really good candidate for our website as well.</p>
			<p class="faqAnswer">All of that being said, some of the more pratical requirments to be able to be added to our site is that both players 
			in the game must be title (a.k.a FM/NM or higher) as well as garner at lot of interest from the wider chess world, meaning 
			multiple people suggested this game, or it becomes widely know about in other ways.</p>
			<h3 class="faqQuestion">How do I get into playing chess?</h3>
			<p class="faqAnswer">Getting into chess is a whole lot of fun and currently it is easier than ever to get started!</p>
			<p class="faqAnswer">Firstly, look to see if there are any local chess clubs around your area. These clubs are always welcoming 
			new members into their communities, regardless of skill level. Also, if you can't get to/do not have any physical culbs nearby 
			chess is very easy to start playing online and the amounts of players has skyrocketed in the last few years.
			<a href="https://www.chess.com" class="faqLink">Chess.com</a> and 
			<a href="https://www.https://lichess.org/" class="faqLink">Lichess</a> are the two biggest sites currently for paying chess 
			online at the moment and I highely reccomend you join there to play games as well</p>
			<p class="faqAnswer">I have also included two videos down below to help you get started in chess. The first is from 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/gothamchess" class="faqLink">Gothamchess</a>, an International Master (IM) who makes 
			highly entertaining, as well as educational videos all about chess. This video is the ultimate begginer guide to chess, 
			breaking down all of the things to know in order to start playing chess.</p>
			<p class="faqAnswer">The second video is from 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHP9CdeguNUI-_nBv_UXBhw" class="faqLink">Daniel Naroditsky</a>, a chess 
			Grandmaster who is among the top players in the world, especially in faster time controls. His videos are for a slightly 
			more advanced chess player, but the guide below is about how to do these steps to get start as we descibed above but in 
			much more detail.</p>
