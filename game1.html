				<!--Game Analysis-->
				<p class="gameText"> This match was the final act in the process to reunify the World Championship. Anand had won the World Championship
				tournament in 2007, and Kramnik was entitled to a rematch. This was the first of two games that Anand won as Black in
				same sharp line of the Meran. Kramnik attempts to refute a new idea over the board, but runs into serious counterplay.
				Anand rejects a drawish line and plays on two pawns down, with Kramnik's king on the run.<br>
				<span>
					1 d4&emsp;d5<br>
					2 c4&emsp;c6<br>
					3 N43&emsp;Nf6<br>
					4 Nc3&emsp;e6<br>
				</span><br>
				Anand is willing to face the Anti-Moscow Gambit.<br>
				<span>
					5 e3&emsp;Nbd7<br>
					6 Bd3&emsp;dxc4<br>
					7 Bxe4&emsp;b5<br>
					8 Bd3&emsp;a6<br>
					9 e4&emsp;c5<br>
					10 e5&emsp;cxd4<br>
					11 Nxb5<br>
				</span><br>
				This is one of the best-established lines of the Classical Meran, named the Blumenfeld Attack. The move itself is an
				exmaple of a desperado, in that a piece that is going to be taken anyway tries to sell its life as dearly as possible.<br>
				<span>
					11 ...&emsp;axb5<br>
				</span><br>
				11...Nxe5 is the other main line, while 11...Ng4 has also been investigated.<br>
				<span>
					12 exf6&emsp;gxf6<br>
					13 O-O4&emsp;Qb6<br>
					14 Qe2<br>
				</span><br>
				In this position, the discussion previously had always been about how Black should defend his pawn. Anand's next move
				opened a new page in Meran theory.<br>
				<span>
					14 ...&emsp;Bb7!?<br>
				</span><br>
				He simply abandons the pawn to its fate, and seeks counterplay against the white king. With the long diagonal and the
				conveniently open g-file converging on g2, this is a tempting idea. This concept is not completely new, but had not been
				tried at a high level, nor had the critical lines been tested. Oddly, Anand and Kasimdzhanov (one of his seconds for this
				match) both had the same idea independently, as they discovered at the first preparation session prior to the Bronn 2008
				match.<br>
				<span>
					15 Bxb5<br>
				</span><br>
				Kramnik takes up the gauntlet. 15 Be4 is more compromising, though 14 Bf4 has been investigated with some success in later 
				games.<br>
				<span>
					15 ...&emsp;Bd6<br>
				</span><br>
				Kramnik made it clear he did not believe Black's idea to be correct and, good as his word, he invited a repeat of the 
				opening line at the next opportunity. Anand deviated here with 15...Rg8!?. Another extremely sharp and tense struggle 
				ensued, with Kramnik running short of time and blundering into a devilish snare: 16 Bf4 Bd6 17 Bg3 f5 18 Rfc1 f4 19 
				Bh4 Be7! 20 a4 Bxh4 21 Nxf4 Ke7 22 Ra3?! Rac8 23 Rxc8 Rxc8 24 Ra1 Qc5 25 Qg4 Qe5 26 Nf3 Qf6 27 Re1 Rc5 28 b4 Rc3 29 
				Nxd4?? Qxd4 30 Rd1 Nf6 31 Rxd4 Nxg4 32 Rd7+ Kf6 33 Rxb7 Rc1+ 34 Bf1 Ne3!! 35 fxe3 fxe3 0-1 Kramnik-Anand, World 
				Championship match (game 5), Bonn 2008. That left Anand with a commanding lead in the match, virtually ensuring a 
				successful defence of his title despite a strong performance by Kramnik in the later games.<br>
				Israeli grandmaster Alon Greenfeld put forward the intriguing view that Anand had prepared both 15...Bd6 and 15...Rg8 
				before the match, and the order in which he played them was based on maintaining maximum surprise value. That is, 15...
				Rg8 can be met by 16 Bf4 and Bg3, which logically suggests 15...Bd6 as a likely "improvement", as it prevents this 
				manoeuvre. Therefore he played the "improvement" first.<br>
				<span>
					16 Rd1<br>
				</span><br>
				Once more Kramnik chooses the most critical reply. Against 16 Nxd4 Anand and his team had worked out a spectacular 
				drawing line: 16...Qxd4 (16...Rg8 is considered worse due to 17 g3, but even this may not be clear) 17 Rd1 Bxh2+ 18 Kxh2 
				Qh4+ 19 Kg1 Bxg2 20 Bxd7+ Ke7 21 Kxg2 Rhg8+ 22 Kf3 Qh5+ 23 Ke3 Qc5+ 24 Kd2 Rad8! 25 Rf1 (25 Qf1 Rxd7+ 26 Ke1 Rxd1+ 27 
				Kxd1 Qh5+ 29 Ke1 Qe5+ 29 Be3 f5 also gives White nothing) 25...Rxd7+ 26 Ke1 Rc8! 27 Qe3 Qa5+ 28 Bd2 Rxd2 29 Qxd2 Qe5+ 
				30 Qe2 Qa5+ with perpetual check.<br>
				<span>
					16 ...&emsp;Rg8<br>
					17 g3&emsp;Rg4!<br>
				</span><br>
				This move had not been played before, and is based on some fiendish tactical ideas.<br>
				<span>
					18 Bf4!<br>
				</span><br>
				Kramnik plays his part in making this a great game. Despite clearly being caught out by a major piece of preparation, 
				he fights for the advantage with vigor. 18 Nd2 is the more obvious move, and it is only with considerable imagination 
				(Or the assistance of an analysis engine) that one can foresee Black's reply: 18...Ke7! (countering the threat of Nc4 
				and perparing to supply a second rook to the kingside attack) 19 Bxd7 (after 19 Qxg4 Qxb5 White's extra exchange will 
				be scant reward for the hopelessly weak light squares around his king) 19...Rag8 20 Bb5 d3! (20...Rxg3+ 21 hxg3 Rxg3+ 
				22 Kf1 Bg2+ 23 Ke1 Re3 24 Nb3 is less clear) 21 Qxd3 Rxg3+ 22 hxg3 Rxg3+ 23 Kf1 Rxd3 24 Bxd3 Qd4 with a draw in lines 
				like 25 Nc4 Bb4 26 a3 Bg2+ 27 Kxg2 Qg4+ or 25 Nb3 Qd5 26 Ke1 Bb4+ 27 Bd2 Qh1+ 28 Ke2 Qf3+.<br>
				<span>
					18 ...&emsp;Bxf4<br>
					19 Nxd4<br>
				</span><br>
				Setting the board on firewith threats against g4, e6 and d7. However, it objectively offers very little, and this may 
				have been where Kramnik intended to vary in game 5 if Anand had allowed him to. 19 Rxd4!? makes it harder for Black to 
				justify his play:<br>
				&emsp;1) 19...Kf8 20 Bxd7 (20 Rxf4 Rxf4 21 gxf4 Nc5 offers white less) 20...Rd8 21 Rad1 Rxd7 22 Rxd7 Rxg3 23 hxg3 Rxg3+ 
				24 Kh2 Bxf3 (Black can't keep attacking chances by 24...Rxf3? because his own king is in greater danger: 25 Rd8+ Kg7 26 
				Rg1+ Kh6 27 Qd2+ Kh5 28 Rd4 Qc7+ 29 Rg3 Rxg3 30 fxg3) 25 Qe3 Rg2+ 26 Kh3 Qxe3 27 fxe3 Rxb2 with an ending where Black 
				has two pawns for the exchange but White has a major asset in the form of his passed a-pawn. However, Black's pieces are 
				well-placed and his own pawns mobile, so he should probablt hold the position.<br>
				&emsp;2) 19...O-O-O 20 Rad1 Bd5 and now:<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;2a) 21 Bc4 Bb7 (21...Bc6 avoids a repetition, but after 22 Rxf4 Rxf4 23 gxf4 Rg8+ 24 Kf1 Black's counterplay 
				is less well defined) 22 Rxf4 (22 Bb5 repeats) 22...Rxf4 23 gxf4 Qc6 and Black's play on the long diagonal is hard to 
				shake off.<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;2b) 21 Rb4 Kc7 22 a3 Be3! 23 Rxg4 Bxf3 24 Rc4+ (24 Qxf3 Ne5 offers White less) 24...Bc5 25 Qxf3 Ne5 26 Qh5 
				Rxd1+ 27 Qxd1 Qxb5 28 Rc3 Nc6 leads to a complex ending. White's queenside pawns are a potent force, but it is hard to 
				see White advancing them all the way to promotion withour Black's queen, bishop, knight and pawn finding counterplay against 
				White's king.<br>
				<span>
					19 ...&emsp;h5!<br>
				</span><br>
				Now it is Anand who will decide whether to take a draw or play on. 19...Rg6 was the alternative:<br>
				&emsp;1) Not 20 Bxd7+ Kxd7 21 Nxe6+ Bd6.<br>
				&emsp;2) 20 a4 is possible, when the sample line 20...Rd8 21 a5 Qc5 22 a6 Ba8 23 Nxe6 fxe6 24 Rxd7 Rxd7 25 Qxe6+ Kf8 26 
				Qxd7 Bxg3 27 Qd8+ Kg7 28 Qd7+ is yet another variation destined to lead to a draw.<br>
				&emsp;3) 20 Nxe6 fxe6 21 Rxd7 Kf8 22 Bd3 Be5 23 Bxg6 hxg6 24 Qc4 Ke8 25 Rh7 Bd4! 26 Rxb7 Bxf2! 27 Kf1 Qxb7 28 Qxe6+ Kf8 
				29 Qxf6+ Kg8 (a line given by Anand's principal assistant, Peter Heine Nielsen) and White must take a draw.<br>
				<span>
					20 Nxe6&emsp;fxe6<br>
					21 Rxd7&emsp;Kf8<br>
					22 Qd3&emsp; Rg7!<br>
				</span><br>
				Anand elects to play on. 22...Bxg3 23 hxg3 h4 24 Rd6 Qc5 25 b4 Qe5 26 Rd8+ Rxd8 27 Qxd8+ Kg7 28 Qe7+ Kh6 29 Qf8+ Kg7 30 
				Qh8+ Rh7 31 Qf8+ Rg7 is a draw. In match play, a comfortable draw as Black is a significant success, so choosing instead 
				to play for a win in an unclear position two pawns down is a gutsy decision by Anand. Two factors no doubt came into play: 
				firstly, he felt that his chances in a tactical shoot-out were good - there is little scope for Kramnik's famed sense for 
				positional nuances to come into play; and secondly, how often could he expect to reach a position with Kramnik's king on 
				the run even in the games where he had White? In a short match, one must make the most of all chances, and a win as Black 
				is of especial value.<br>
				<span>
					23 Rxg7&emsp;Kxg7<br>
					24 gxf4&emsp;Rd8<br>
					25 Qe2&emsp;Kh6!<br>
				</span><br>
				Black's king is much the safer of the two. Meanwhile White's queenside pawns will not be a threat in the near future.<br>
				<span>
					26 Kf1&emsp;Rg8<br>
					27 a4&emsp;Bg2+<br>
					28 Ke1&emsp;Bh3<br>
					29 Ra3?!<br>
				</span><br>
				Running low on time, Kramnik starts to go astray. 29 Rd1! Bg4 (29...Rg1+ 30 Kd2 Rg2 31 Qe3 Rxf2+ 32 Be2 Rxe2+ 33 Qxe2 
				Bg4 34 Qd3 Qxb2+ 35 Qc2 Qb4+ 36 Kc1 Qa3+ 37 Kd2 Qd6+ 38 Kc1 is drawn, the key point being 38...Bxd1 39 Qxd1 Qxf4+?? 
				40 Qd2 and the a pawn promotes; 29...Bf5 also maintains sufficient compensation) 30 Qe3! Qxe3+ 31 fxe3 Bxd1 32 Kxd1 
				leads to an ending where White's queenside pawns come into their own and insure White against loss.<br>
				<span>
					29 ...&emsp;Rg1+<br>
					30 Kd2&emsp;Qd4+<br>
					31 Kc2&emsp;Bg4?<br>
				</span><br>
				31...Bf5+! 32 Rd3 (32 Kb3 Rc1! 33 a5 Qd5+ 34 Bc4 Qb7+ 35 Ka4 {35 Bb5? Bc2+ 36 Ka2 Qh1 mates} 35..Rc2! is likely a win 
				for Black) 32...Rg4 leaves White in difficulties.<br>
				<span>
					32 f3?<br>
				</span><br>
				32 Rd3! Bf5 33 Kb3 Bxd3 34 Qxd3 and White will salvage a draw, either due to the strength of his queenside pawns or by 
				counterplay against the black king.<br>
				<span>
					32 ...&emsp;Bf5+<br>
					33 Bd3?<br>
				</span><br>
				33 Kb3 Rc1! 34 a5 Qd5+ 35 Bc4 Qb7+ 36 Bb5 (Black lacks ...Qh1 here; 36 Ka4 is again answered by 36...Rc2) 36...Rc2 37 
				a6 Qb6 38 Qf1 Qe3+ 39 Ka2 Qd2 40 Qb1 Rc1 and Black wins.<br>
				<span>
					33 ...&emsp;Bh3?<br>
				</span><br>
				Good enough, but missing an immediate win by the straightforward 33...Bxd3+ 34 Rxd3 (34 Qxd3 Rg2+ 35 Kc1 Qxb2+ 36 Kd1 
				Rg1+ mates) 34...Qc4+, when White is either mated or loses his queen.<br>
				<span>
					34 a5?!<br>
				</span><br>
				Black should win after 34 Qd2 Rg2 35 Be2 Bf5+ 36 Kc1 Qg1+ 37 Qd1 Qxh2, but with both players short of time and clearly
